START
You arrive at the edge of Camp Greenwood for a weekend retreat.
Most of the group went ahead earlier, but you got delayed on the road.
Now the sun is setting, and you need to catch up.
You can a) follow the trail toward the old ranger cabin, or b) take the footpath along the river.

PATH_CABIN, PATH_RIVER

PATH_CABIN
The path leads you to a small wooden cabin with a dim lantern glowing in the window.
The door is shut, and the place feels abandoned.
You can a) knock on the door, or b) check the toolshed behind the cabin.

CABIN_DOOR, CHECK_SHED

CABIN_DOOR
You knock twice. A tired-looking park ranger opens the door.
He’s surprised to see you and warns that the area has had odd animal activity.
You can a) stay and ask him for directions, or b) thank him and head back outside.

TALK_RANGER, LEAVE_CABIN

CHECK_SHED
The shed creaks as you open it. Inside, you spot a dusty map pinned to the wall.
You also notice a huge spider web in the corner.
You can a) take the map, or b) try clearing the web.

FIND_MAP, SPIDER_END

TALK_RANGER
The ranger offers to walk with you part of the way.
He also mentions a shortcut through the forest if you're in a hurry.
You can a) accept his offer, or b) take the shortcut alone.

RANGER_GUIDE, FOREST_SHORTCUT

LEAVE_CABIN
You step back into the cold evening. The wind picks up and the forest grows darker.
You try to retrace your steps but lose the path completely.
Eventually you decide to wait until morning. The end.



FIND_MAP
The map is old but clear. It shows two routes to the camp:
a forest shortcut, and a safer path crossing the river bridge.
You can a) take the forest shortcut, or b) head toward the bridge.

FOREST_SHORTCUT, RIVER_CROSSING

SPIDER_END
The web doesn’t budge. As you keep pulling, the shelf above collapses,
sending tools flying everywhere. You sprint out of the shed
and decide it’s safer to head home. The end.



RANGER_GUIDE
You and the ranger walk together for twenty minutes until you see
the campfire lights in the distance. The group cheers when you arrive. The end.



FOREST_SHORTCUT
The shortcut is quiet, almost too quiet. After a few minutes,
the path splits unexpectedly. You can a) go left toward a rocky
cave entrance, or b) continue straight toward a bright clearing.

LOST_CAVE, CLEARING

RIVER_CROSSING
You reach the bridge marked on the map. The water below is fast and loud.
You can a) cross the bridge carefully, or b) hop across the stones
along the side of the bridge.

BRIDGE_SAFE, FALL_IN

LOST_CAVE
You step into the cave. The air is colder than outside, and you hear
dripping water echoing through the walls. After walking deeper,
you realize the tunnel twists too much to navigate. You head back
and wait for daylight. The end.



CLEARING
The clearing opens up to a wide view of Camp Greenwood. You spot your group
laughing around a small fire. You call out, they wave, and you're soon
sharing warm cider with them. The end.



BRIDGE_SAFE
You cross slowly, gripping the railing. The boards creak, but you make
it across safely. A few minutes later, the lights of the camp appear.
The end.



FALL_IN
You slip on a wet stone and fall into the river. Luckily the current
pushes you to a shallow bank downstream. You're soaked, freezing,
and absolutely done for the night. The end.
