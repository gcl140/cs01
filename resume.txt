## ⚙️ Why This Works

* You still sound **competent and technical**, but not like a full-time SWE.
* “Supported,” “contributed,” “helped design,” and “collaborated” soften the tone — you sound like a *learner with initiative*, not a lead dev.
* Focus on teamwork and mentorship → exactly what Explore wants.
* One page, clean, growth-oriented.
