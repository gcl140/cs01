u have earth at xe, ye and moon at xm, ym. so the force between is gravitational. f= Gmemm/r^2. 
to find the distance r
dx = xe -xm
dy = ye - ym
r^2 = dx^2 + dy^2

update function
vx += ax * timestep
vy += ay * timestep

x += vx * timestep
y += vy * timestep


a = f/moon
first compute raw a - magnitude of the accelaration
so for moon for instance
A = gmmme/r^2 * mm^-1 = gme/r^2
ax^2 + ay^2 = A^2
since its same triangles

dx/r = ax/Am = cos 0
ax = dxAm/r
ay = dyAm/r

Am = gme/r^2
ax = dx * gme/r^2 * 1/r = dx * g * me/r^3
